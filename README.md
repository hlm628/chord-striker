# Chord Striker

A Python library for generating random harmonic song structures. The results are formatted into PDF chord charts by Lilypond, and supplied with an accompanying MIDI file. If you're stuck in a creative rut, this can be an excellent way to start writing a new song! I like to load the MIDI file into a DAW and start building on top of it.

Example outputs can be seen in the [example directory](./example).
