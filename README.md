# Chord Striker

A Python library for generating random harmonic song structures. The results are formatted into PDF chord charts by Lilypond, and supplied with an accompanying MIDI file. If you're stuck in a creative rut, this can be an excellent way to start writing a new song! I like to load the MIDI file into a DAW and start building on top of it.

Example outputs can be seen in the [example directory](./example).

## Features

- Generate random chord progressions with musical coherence
- Create full song structures with intros, verses, pre-choruses, choruses, and so on
- Add realistic variations to chord progressions
- Export to PDF chord charts using Lilypond
- Generate accompanying MIDI files
- Cross-platform support via Docker
- Create full albums of songs

## How It Works

Chord Striker uses probability and music theory to generate song structures. 

- First, a section layout is generated. This works by sampling from a probalistic directed acyclic graph (DAG) that models common song transitions. The details can be found in `chord_striker/probabilistic_dag.py` and `chord_striker/song_structure.py`.
- Then each section is populated with chord progressions. These are generated in one of two ways: either by sampling from a list of pre-defined "famous" chord progressions, or from a Markov chain that models how chords transition between one another. The details can be found in `chord_striker/chorder.py`. Repetitions of sections may have small variations (e.g. a chord change, an added chord, or a different length).
- Finally, the resulting song structure is exported to Lilypond, which converts it into a PDF chord chart and accompanying MIDI file.

There are a number of hard-coded parameters that can be modified to change the sound of the generated songs. These can be found in the `constants` directory and are loaded by `chord_striker/load_constants.py`. Experimenting with these is a good way to impart your own style into the generated songs.

## Installation

### Using Docker (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started is using Docker:

```bash
# Build the Docker image
make docker

# Enter the container
make enter
```

### Manual Installation

1. Install Python 3.11 or later
2. Install Lilypond (version 2.22.1 or later)
3. Install the Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r docker/requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Generate a single song:
```bash
make run-song
```

Generate multiple songs (default: 10):
```bash
make run-album
```

Generate a test song with specific parameters:
```bash
make test SONG_NAME="My Song" SEED=42
```

### Output

The generated files will be placed in the `example` directory by default. Each song generation creates:
- A PDF chord chart
- A MIDI file
- A Lilypond source file
- An auxillary file for Lilypond containing the chord symbols

### Customization

You can customize the output by modifying:
- `SONG_NAME`: Name of the generated song
- `SEED`: Random seed for reproducible results
- `OUTPUT_DIR`: Directory for generated files
- `ALBUM_TRACKS`: Number of songs to generate (for `run-album`)
