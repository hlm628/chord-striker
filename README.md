# Chord Striker

A Python library for generating harmonic song structures at random. The results are formatted into chord charts by Lilypond, output as a PDF and accompanying MIDI file. If you're stuck in a creative rut, this can be an excellent way to start writing a new song!

An example output is shown below:
